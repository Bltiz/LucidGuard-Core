🌌 Open-Source Core | 🛰️ Professional Detection | 💎 Zero-Trust Architecture
The modular open-source engine for LucidGuard. Featuring high-performance violation management, state-aware false-positive prevention, and advanced core security for FiveM servers.
LucidGuard is a high-performance, modular anti-cheat engine designed specifically for FiveM. Unlike "all-in-one" scripts that bloat your server, LucidGuard provides a rock-solid Free Core foundation focused on high-speed violation management and state-aware protection.

Our architecture is built on a Zero-Trust model, ensuring that every player action is validated through our intelligent "Brain" before a verdict is reached, virtually eliminating false positives caused by lag or game physics.

✨ Core Features (Free Edition)
🧠 Intelligent Violation Manager: Tracks suspicious behavior across multiple categories before issuing a punishment.

🛰️ State-Aware Protection: Automatically bypasses detections during legitimate game states like spawning, falling, or being in a ragdoll state.

⚡ Ultra-Low Resmon: Optimized Lua logic that maintains a near-zero impact on client and server FPS.

🌐 Universal Bridge: Built-in exports that allow any external script or module to communicate directly with the core.

📡 Advanced Logging: Detailed Discord and console logs featuring player identifiers, location data, and detection evidence.

🚀 Expansion Modules (Coming Soon)
